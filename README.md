# The project
This project was made to compare 3 apps. [One made for Android](https://github.com/DeRidderJonas/BAP_Todo_Android), [one made for iOS](https://github.com/DeRidderJonas/BAP_Todo_iOS) and [one made for both in Flutter](https://github.com/DeRidderJonas/BAP_Todo_Flutter).

In each of these projects, each of these mechanics are implemented and compared on how easy/hard they are to use for a new Android/iOS/Flutter developer:
* Screen navigation
* Saving data
* Input fields of different types
* Component types
* Native features
* 3rd party libraries
* using network APIs
* Push notifications
* Creating a lay-out
